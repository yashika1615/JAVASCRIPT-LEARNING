*How JavaScript works?
Ans-Everything in JavaScript happens inside an "execution context".

Execution context has two component
1)memory component[variable environment] 
-This is the place where all variables and functions are stored as key value pairs. eg-{key: value ||  n:2;} 

 2)code component[Thread of execution]
-This is the place where code is executed one line at a time

Note-
*JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language

-Single threaded means JavaScript can execute once command at a time
-Synchronous single-threaded that means JavaScript can execute one command at a time in a specific order.

 Execution Context Creation and its 2 phases: Memory Allocation Phase and the Code Execution phase.

This video also answers questions about- 
Is Javascript Single-threaded or multi-threaded? 
Is JS Synchronous or asynchronous?

everything in js happens inside an execution context
like a big box and has 2 component- memory also known as variable env
2nd- code component known as thread of exceution
like a thread where the whole code is executed one line aat a time
js is synchronous single threaded language- can exceute one command at a time and only in specific order
js is not possible without this exceution context


//what happens when you excute a js code
exceution context is created
the exceution context is created in 2 phase- first is creation phase also known as memory creation phase
js will allocate memory to all varibales and functions

when it allocates memory to n it stores the values a undefined and incase of functions it stores the whole code
other varibales-undefined
 2nd phase-code exceution phase- line by line exceution

 when a new fuction is invoked a brand new exceution context iscreated
 
js is brain of web applications
js code is executed by something called js engine and every browser has its own js engine to execute its own js code
chrome has v8 engine
firefox has spidermonkey
microsoft has chakra
and safari has javascript code
