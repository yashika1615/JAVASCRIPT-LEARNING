*How JavaScript works?
Ans-Everything in JavaScript happens inside an "execution context".

Execution context has two component
1)memory component[variable environment] 
-This is the place where all variables and functions are stored as key value pairs. eg-{key: value ||  n:2;} 

 2)code component[Thread of execution]
-This is the place where code is executed one line at a time

Note-
*JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language

-Single threaded means JavaScript can execute once command at a time
-Synchronous single-threaded that means JavaScript can execute one command at a time in a specific order.

 Execution Context Creation and its 2 phases: Memory Allocation Phase and the Code Execution phase.

This video also answers questions about- 
Is Javascript Single-threaded or multi-threaded? 
Is JS Synchronous or asynchronous?

everything in js happens inside an execution context
like a big box and has 2 component- memory also known as variable env
2nd- code component known as thread of exceution
like a thread where the whole code is executed one line aat a time
js is synchronous single threaded language- can exceute one command at a time and only in specific order
js is not possible without this exceution context


//what happens when you excute a js code
exceution context is created
the exceution context is created in 2 phase- first is creation phase also known as memory creation phase
js will allocate memory to all varibales and functions

when it allocates memory to n it stores the values a undefined and incase of functions it stores the whole code
other varibales-undefined
 2nd phase-code exceution phase- line by line exceution

 when a new fuction is invoked a brand new exceution context iscreated
 
js is brain of web applications
js code is executed by something called js engine and every browser has its own js engine to execute its own js code
chrome has v8 engine
firefox has spidermonkey
microsoft has chakra
and safari has javascript code

node js is an open source and cross platform javascript runtime environment . It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project. 

types
primitive types/ value types
string 

no matter if the variable declared is float or integer the type is going to be number only

js/python- dynamic language
-both the type and the value can be changed

static language- value change but not type change

//reference types
0bjects/ arrays/functions
arrays and functions are objects only

how js code is executed-
execution context- environment consituting your env, variables, functions
everytime you run or exceute a javascript code theres and execution context created
 so initially theres a global exceution context created and everytime you craete a new function a new exceution context is created and will be added to the call stack 
 this execution context has 2 main components- the first component is before running the javascript code - memory is allocated to the variables and functions that is why this phase is called memory phase 
 and in the second phase the code is executed line by line - kavascript is synchronous single threaded language and that is why the second phase is called the code phase 

hoisting
temporal dead zone

this

let var const
//let, var and const
//const and let are more strict use const 
// whenever you want you want your value to be constant 
// and it cannot be changed , use let otherwise avoid using var

//lexical scope- you basically check where it is located and 
// can we access it or not
